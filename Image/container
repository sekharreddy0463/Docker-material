Docker Image
A Docker image is a template or blueprint for creating containers.
It is a read-only file that contains everything needed to run an application, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, environment variables, and configuration files.
Images are static and don't change once created, making them portable and reusable across environments.
They are created using a Dockerfile which defines the instructions for building the image.
Docker Container
A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image.
It is a live, running environment that operates based on the image but includes writable layers, meaning you can interact with it, run processes, and store temporary data during its lifecycle.
Containers can be started, stopped, moved, or deleted independently, giving flexibility to run applications in isolation.
Each container is isolated and encapsulates its environment, but they share the host OS kernel.
Key Differences
Image: Blueprint for the environment; read-only and static.
Container: Running instance of an image; read-write and dynamic.
